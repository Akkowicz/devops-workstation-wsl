# devops-workstation-wsl
Repo that I'm using for setting up a WSL2 environment for various DevOps tasks.

## Getting started
To get started, install WSL2, you can use the script from https://github.com/Layer8Err/WSL2setup:

```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JfKrM'))
```

It may be necessary to run the script twice.
